-------------- URL links are in the 'HurstysCreationList.txt' text document --------------

This list contains url links to every theme I have made (that I can remember) and shared with the gaming community.
EmulationStation, Attract Mode, Batocera/RetroBat, Handhelds and towards the bottom of the list are links to tons of wheel art and media I have made.

I am not really creating or updating themes any more, but I am open to making 'small' changes if you reach out.
Making themes became an obsession and I had a blast churning out themes becasue I love creation hobbies.

Huge thanks to anyone who has helped me learn over the years with this hobby.
David Marty is not only a great bloke, but all of my 2000 ES Themes would never had happened if he didn't help me get started. I am not a coder and code is very challenging to me, even today. He has also been extremely generous and helpfull to me for a long time now.

Batocera has taken over these days and it is great, but if you want to have a crack at creating your own EmulationStation Theme, I made a video to try and help you get started:
